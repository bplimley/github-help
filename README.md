# Git branching and workflow
[git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) by Vincent Driessen (1/5/2010) describes a formalized workflow using `master`, `develop`, `release` branch, feature branches, and hotfixes.
[github-flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) by Scott Chacon (8/31/2011) describes a simpler workflow, using only `master` and feature branches. Continuous integration and GitHub pull requests ensure that features are stable before merging into `master`.
